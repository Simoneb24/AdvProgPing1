Brief description of your part of the appâ€™s functionality.
- my part of the app is meant to keep track of students assignments and any studying they may have to
- it includes an input where the user types in everything they have to do for homework
- it then uses a checkbox feature to be able to show when your work is completed and what you have left to do
- it is very helpful to keep track of all of your work
- works well as a to do list and for a lot of students, like me, it helps them stay organized and not forget any of their work 
- I am also working on adding an extracurricular section to this part of the app where students can enter their practices and game to plan accordingly
  
List of features implemented.
- The app includes three main tabs, "all homework," "needs to be done," and "already finished."
- after checking the box next to your assignment it indicates that it is done and it automatically moves to the already finished tab
- Also has a count of the total assignments that the user has to do

Known issues (if any).
- I would like to add a due date section where the user inputs the date that their work is due
- I think this would help the user plan better in advance
- also a bit of an issue running the code from simones computer and integrating my part of the app into her code
- might have to break down my code and seperate it more into different parts rather than having it all in one place
- create a general code and then call upon each class within
  
Key functions explained briefly.
- The main functions I wrote are made to add a new assignment, edit an assignment, save an assignment, clear the old assignments, and switch between tabs
- toggle_edit allows you to edit a previous assignment entered, change its name/what the assignment is
- save_clicked allows the user input to be saved and listed below
- status_changed allows the user to change the status of their work to completed
- add_clicked allows the user to add a new assignment to their list of homework
- homework_delete allows the user to delete an assignment or clear completed assignments
