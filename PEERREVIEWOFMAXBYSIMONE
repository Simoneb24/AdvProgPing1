PEER REVIEW

CODE READABILITY
- Functions are well and descriptively named and it is easy to understand the logic
-the comments are helpful and lay things out clearly
-organization via multiple classes is a little bit confusing and it may have been easier to have one class per script

CODE STRUCTURE
- The use of instantiation is very innovative and impressive
-the logical flow of extracurriculars is well thought out it was smart to access the date from Pythons database
- I am a little confused about the self. for everything not that I think its wrong I just wonder if it could be streamlined

USE OF PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS
- incredible use of thread, that is very cool
-good use of for loops in clear_clicked
-good use of except
-couldn't find any traditional use of lists but there must be one to track extracurriculars 
beacuse you use .append, I wonder if the list was substituted for a thread

FUNCTIONALITY
- Homework works wonderfully, is streamlined and incredibly versatile
-the interface is also aesthetic
-extracurriculars doesn't currently work but is certainly getting there


SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
- The is typically more than one class per script wich is somthing that makes 
integration really difficult, perhaps each class should be seperated into diffrent scripts
-a lot of funcions are called, but don't do anything as far as I can tell, like extacurricular_delete
so maybe it would be beneficial to work on one thing at a time
