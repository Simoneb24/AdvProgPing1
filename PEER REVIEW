PEER REVIEW

CODE READABILITY
- very easy to understand after reading through it a couple times
- could rename some functions to make their purpose a bit clearer and easier for someone who doesn't already know what the codes purpose is to understand
- example for above, could change the function name "classes_good" to something a bit more meaningful to its purpose
- really good use of indentation, helps make it easy to follow while reading
- could a some more comments, always super helpful

CODE STRUCTURE
- really well formatted, easy to undersatnd functionality of the different classes
- good use of a list to keep track of each block in the schedule
- the functions are defined clearly and their usage is mostly very clear

USE OF PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS
- very good use of variables in your code
- well used loop inside of the "checkname" function
- well formatted list, called upon well throughout the code to allow user to input their own courses in
- good use of functions, some could have more meaningful names like I said before

FUNCTIONALITY
- everything works very well for me when I tried all the code
- all the UI looks great
- app is very clear and easy to navigate
- instructions within the UI on the app are super helpful

SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
- overall really good and impressive code, some minor suggestions for improvement I have are:
- naming your functions to make them a bit clearer and easier to follow when reading the code,
for the most part I could tell their purpose but someone who doesn't know how the app works already
might be a little confused at some points. 
- Another thing I think you could possibly improve in your code is maybe breaking down the "data_gather"
function and splitting it into 2 or 3 seperate functions. The one function seems to be doing a lot, maybe 
too much. It sets up UI, handles the file, and also manages user inputs. It might make a bit more sense
to split it up a bit. With that being said, the code works well so it doesn't seem like a super urgent change.
